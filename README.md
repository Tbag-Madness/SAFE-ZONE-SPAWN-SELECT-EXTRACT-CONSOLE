## **Features**

### **Player Spawn Safe Zone**
- A **safe zone** is created for players at the beginning of the game. It provides a designated area where players can safely spawn without immediate threats from other players or zombies.

### **Bunker with 24 Player Lockups**
- The mod adds a **bunker** in the safe zone that includes **24 player-specific lockups**. Each player can store items securely in their own private storage area.

### **Teleport Spawn Locations**
- Players can choose from **8 teleport spawn locations** scattered across the map, allowing them to select their preferred spawn point from the available options.

### **Extraction Zones**
- Two **extraction zones** are located at **Pavlovo** and **Kamensk_MB**. These extraction zones allow players to safely extract from the map and return to the designated safe zone.
